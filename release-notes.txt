 - The goal for this release is to implement a framework for BIP32
   on which to build, the more interesting features possible with bip32 keys can
   be implemented later.  For this release we aim to implement a hierarchical 
   deterministic wallet - which means you can recover all the keys in a wallet
   using only the master key.
 
 - Added basic BIP32 support
    
    
    - Each extended key can derive 2^31 normal child keys and 2^31 hardened
      child keys.
        - 
    
    - All new keys are deterministically generated from a master key.
        - The complete wallet state (except key labels) can be recreated from 
          a single master key.
    
    - When the wallet is first started a new master bip32 key will be generated
      from the master key, internal (child 1) and external (child 0) chains are 
      derived from the master key.
      
      The wallet will only generate a master key automatically once.
      If the first master key is removed a new key will need to be imported
      manually for the wallet to be able to generate keys.
        
    
    - New prefix for base58 data
        - extended key identifiers are represented in the same way as normal 
          Gameunits addresses, to prevent confusion a new prefix has been added.
    
    - New rpc function extkey, alias: bip32
        
        - path
            The path is a backslash deliminated string of digits.
            m/3/4h/5
            Only backslashes, digits and m, h and ' may occur in the path.
            
            The tokens m and 0 can only be first or last in the path.
        
        - examples:
            - extkey <bip32_key> <path>
                - returns the child key according to the path
            - extkey gen 
                - generates new key from random data
                - extkey <passphrase> <nun hashes> <seed string>
                    Match bip32.org keys: bip32 gen "pass" 50000 "Bitcoin seed"
    
    - Notes
        - The change address of anon transactions is picked as the first stealth
          address of default account else the first legacy stealth address.
 
 - Added Gitian build descriptors
    - See contrib/gitian-descriptors/README
 
 - SMSG ScanBlock harvest public keys from coinstake transactions
 
 - Added "Txn Type" field to txnreport
 
 - Added 'env' parameter to getinfo
    - returns more environment specific information
 
 - Added simple command line interface to gameunitsd
    - enabled with new parameter "cli" when not started as a daemon

 - Added createmultisig rpc command
    - createmultisig does the same as existing command addmultisigaddress
      except that the resulting address and script are not added to the wallet.

 - decoderawtransaction scriptPubKey includes the hex representation
    - hex of a prevout scriptPubKey is required for signrawtransaction
 
 - signrawtransaction works when private keys are passed in as parameters
    - adds redeemScript to the tempKeystore

 - Added option to disable SMSG scanning of incoming blocks.
    - smsgoptions set scanIncoming false

 - smsgoptions command is now case insensitive
 - smsgoptions list takes a bool parameter to list option descriptions
 
 - dumpprivkey takes a pubkey as input
 
 - More unit tests enabled
  - The coin_selection_tests sometimes fail, it's related to the nSpendTime
    parameter and isn't a real error.

 - Gui improvements
  - Lock icon goes orange when system unlocked for staking only.
  - Table pagination icons limited to 5.
